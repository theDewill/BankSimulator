Certainly! Here's an example scenario we'll use for demonstrating the Zimular framework:

### Example Scenario: Manufacturing Process Simulation

#### Description:
We'll simulate a simplified manufacturing process consisting of three main stages: Modeling, Inspection, and Packing. Entities representing products move through these stages, undergoing various processes and inspections.

#### Components:
1. **Modeling Machine**: Constructs the product model.
2. **Inspection Machine**: Inspects the product for quality control.
3. **Packing Machine**: Packs the finalized product for shipment.

#### Workflows:
1. **Modeling Workspace**: Entities are modeled here.
2. **Inspection Workspace**: Entities are inspected for quality.
3. **Packing Workspace**: Finalized products are packed here.

#### Goals:
- Simulate the manufacturing process to identify bottlenecks and optimize production efficiency.
- Monitor the system's performance and analyze key metrics such as throughput and cycle time.

#### Key Features:
- Configurable settings for adjusting simulation parameters.
- Real-time visualization of the simulation using rich terminal tables.
- Integration with external systems via HTTP and WebSocket protocols for data exchange and analysis.

### Code Example:
We'll provide Python code examples for the following components and workflows:
- `components.py`: Defines the simulation components (e.g., Modeling Machine, Inspection Machine).
- `workflow.py`: Implements the workflows for each stage of the manufacturing process.
- `generator.py`: Generates entities for the simulation.
- `main.py`: Initializes the simulation environment and orchestrates the simulation process.

This example will demonstrate how to set up and run a simulation using the Zimular framework, showcasing its flexibility and extensibility for modeling complex systems.
